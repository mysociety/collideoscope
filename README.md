Collideoscope
=============

This repository holds extra collideoscope-specific code that doesn't belong in
the main [FixMyStreet repository](https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet).

Currently, this is just the Perl code for processing Stats19 data into a
FixMyStreet database.

The main code that makes http://collideosco.pe work is still inside the
[FixMyStreet repository](https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet) as a
cobrand.
