Subject: Complete your report on [% site_name %]

Hello [% report.name || report.email %],

Thanks for beginning a report on [% site_name %]. We know it can be stressful
dealing with the aftermath of a cycling collision or near-miss, so here’s a
quick run down of what you should do next, in your own time:

1. Complete your report on [% site_name %] using this link:

   [% token_url %]

   Your report will be sent to the local council, who will often use it when
   planning infrastructure changes and eductional programmes. Plus it’ll become
   part of the public [% site_name %] incident dataset, used by planners and
   campaigners around the UK.

2. If your incident involved a motor vehicle and any sort of injury or damage
   to property, you should also report it to the Police, using the link we’ll
   send to you, once you’ve completed your [% site_name %] report.

   Hopefully the driver of the vehicle will already have reported the incident,
   but if they haven’t, your report will help the Police investigate a possible
   offence under Section 170 of the Road Traffic Act.

By reporting collisions and near-misses like yours, you’re helping us build the
evidence base for cycle safety improvements, together. Completing your report
will only take a few minutes, but will contribute a huge amount to our cause:
