Information you provide in this section will never be shown online, but will be
sent to the local council, so that they are aware of potentially dangerous
hotspots for cyclists. Some councils may respond to ask for further information
or to keep you updated on any measures they are taking towards making the
location safer. (<a href="/privacy">[% loc('See our privacy policy') %]</a>.)
