        Drivers who cause injury or damage must either stop and exchange
        details with the other parties involved, or report the incident to
        the police. If they don’t, they’re in breach of
        <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/170">
        Section 170 of the Road Traffic Act 1988</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="confirmation-header__more" style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5">
        The police will often also want to know more about the incident—including
        video or photo evidence, if you have it—to determine whether the driver
        could be charged with a dangerous driving offence.
