<h1 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>What is this site for?</dt>
    <dd>Collideoscope invites you to report cycling collisions and near misses
    in the UK. It collects the reports together and makes the data available to
    planners, researchers and campaigners with the aim of making our roads safer
    for all.</dd>

    <dt>Who is behind this site?</dt>
    <dd>It’s a joint project from <a
    href="https://www.mysociety.org">mySociety</a> and the <a
    href="https://www.no-excuses.org.uk">Merseyside Road Safety Partnership</a>,
    and it’s powered by mySociety’s long-running <a
    href="https://fixmystreet.org">FixMyStreet platform</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="reporting">Making a report</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>What kind of reports can be made on Collideoscope?</dt>
    <dd>You can report actual collisions between a bicycle and another vehicle,
    or near misses where an incident was averted. Additionally you may report
    incidents where no other vehicle was involved, such as collisions or near
    misses with pedestrians, street furniture... or anything else.</dd>
    <dd>Please <strong>do not report incidents requiring immediate medical or
    police attention</strong> — or at least, not until you have requested help
    via the emergency services’ official channels.</dd>

    <dt>Where do reports go?</dt>
    <dd>Reports are sent to the local authority with responsibility for the area
    in which the incident occured. Additionally, the data is published on this
    site and is available to anyone who might like to use it, such as
    researchers, town planners, campaigners and local residents. <a
    href="/reports">Find out more.</a></dd>

    <dt>Why should I make a report?</dt>
    <dd>By contributing to the data on Collideoscope, you’re helping to build up
    a picture of how, why and where cyclists are at danger. This data can be
    analysed to help town planners make better decisions, and also provides an
    invaluable evidence base for those campaigning for safer cycling
    conditions.</dd>

    <dt>What is the point of reporting near misses?</dt>
    <dd>We all know areas that are ‘an accident waiting to happen’. Evidence of
    multiple near-misses can be a strong indication that conditions need to be
    improved in these hotspots. Equally, we should not discount the effects of a
    near miss on a cyclist’s sense of security — an issue is still worth
    addressing to avoid such incidents.</dd>

    <dt>Do I need to be a cyclist to make a report?</dt>
    <dd>No; anyone who has witnessed a collision or near miss involving a
    bicycle can submit a report.</dd>

    <dt>Are reports anonymous?</dt>
    <dd>We ask for your name and email address when you make your report. These
    are shared with the council, who may get back to you for further
    information. Your email address (and phone number if you’ve chosen to give
    it) are <em>not</em> published on the site; and you may choose whether or
    not your name is published. <a href="/about/privacy">See full details in our
    Privacy Policy.</a></dd>

    <dt>What does a good Collideoscope report include?</dt>
    <dd>Give as much <strong>factual information</strong> as you can. This will
    be useful for researchers, planners and councils, who use data in aggregate
    to understand factors such as how the time, the location, or other traffic
    may affect the level of safety. The fields in the Collideoscope form guide
    you to provide the essential information here.</dd>
    <dd>Try not to include personally-identifiable information (such as people’s
    names or addresses, or vehicle license plate numbers) in your report.</dd>

    <dt>Why can’t my report include a photo or video?</dt>
    <dd>We don’t provide this facility on Collideoscope, because if you are
    intending to also send a report to the police, putting video evidence of
    your incident online can compromise any subsequent court hearing.
    Additionally, where a vehicle’s numberplate is clearly shown, associating
    the photograph to public accusations of wrongdoing may constitute libel.
    Police say that they often find this type of evidence invaluable, but it
    should be relayed to them directly and not shared in a public arena where
    others can comment on it.</dd>

    <dt>What happens next?</dt>
    <dd>Once you have filed your report via Collideoscope, it will immediately
    appear on the website. At the same time, the details will be sent off to
    your local council, who may or may not wish to follow up with you.</dd>
    <dd>Your report also becomes part of the anonymised data which is available
    for researchers and others to download.</dd>
    <dd>If your incident involved a motor vehicle and injury, we’ll send an automated
    follow-up after a month, to ask whether you reported it to the police, and
    you heard back from them as a result.</dd>

    <dt>Should I also make a report to the police?</dt>
    <dd>Any incident resulting in injury must be reported by law.</dd>
    <dd>In some cases, incidents resulting in damage to property (eg your bike,
    a car, a street barrier) must be reported, either in person at the nearest
    police station or online.</dd>
    <dd>Where the incident involves a motorised vehicle (eg a car, motorbike,
    lorry, etc), the driver has responsibility for reporting, but we suggest
    that the cyclist also makes a report, in case the driver neglects to do so.
    Also note that if you are hoping to make a claim on your insurance, in most
    cases you will require a crime reference number, which is obtained when you
    make a police report.</dd>
    <dd>Once you’ve added your report to Collideoscope, we’ll guide you to where
    you can make a police report if appropriate. For other incidents (eg
    dangerous driving or abusive behaviour) you may wish to report via the
    non-emergency <a href="tel:101">101</a> police line.</dd>

    <dt>What does a good police report include?</dt>
    <dd>Get in touch with the police as soon as possible after the incident, as
    any CCTV evidence may be wiped if you leave it too long — and besides, it
    will be easier to remember all the details.</dd>
    <dd>The police will ask you the relevant questions so that they obtain all
    the facts they need for their standardised incident report. Ideally, you
    should be prepared with as much information as you can recall or gather
    about the exact time of day, the location, the factors which led up to the
    incident, and anyone else present.</dd>
    <dd>If a motor vehicle was involved, the registration number or driver’s
    contact details will be invaluable — but if you did not manage to obtain
    these, then other identifying information such as the colour, make or other
    features (eg bus number, branding on commercial vehicles, etc) will
    help.</dd>
    <dd>Any supporting evidence such as photographs or videos can be extremely
    useful to the police — but take care not to share these publicly on social
    media, as they may prejudice any court case that subsequently occurs. Just
    pass them directly to the police instead.</dd>

<h2 id="issues">When things don’t go as planned</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Collideoscope doesn’t recognise the postcode I’m trying to input</dt>
    <dd>Our postcode data comes from Ordnance Survey. If you have a relatively
    new postcode, it may not yet be reflected on OS, and therefore on
    Collideoscope.</dd>
    <dd>It’s ok though, you can still use the site: just enter a nearby place
    name, street name or let the site locate you automatically, instead. You can
    use the pan and zoom controls at the top right hand corner of the screen to
    zero in on the precise location.</dd>

    <dt>My street isn’t on your map</dt>
    <dd>Collideoscope’s default maps are from OpenStreetMap, so updates to our
    maps happen when they refresh their data. If you can’t see the street you
    want to make a report on, your best bet is to use the map to pinpoint the
    location as accurately as you can, then describe the problem location in as
    much detail as possible in the description box.</dd>

    <dt>I haven’t received a confirmation email</dt>
    <dd>Please check your spam folder – this is the most common reason that
    confirmation emails cannot be found.</dd>
    <dd>Unfortunately, it is hard for us to avoid from our end, but by adding us
    to your email whitelist, you will prevent this happening in future.</dd>

    <dt>You sent my report to the wrong council</dt>
    <dd>Please check that you placed your pin correctly, as this is a very
    common reason for misdirected reports. If your problem is very near a
    council boundary, it is easy to place the pin on the wrong side of it by
    mistake.</dd>
    <dd>If your pin is in the correct location, please <a href="/contact">drop
    us a line</a> and we’ll try to get to the bottom of why your report has been
    misrouted. Please include the URL (web address) of your Collideoscope
    report.</dd>

    <dt>I want to update my report</dt>
    <dd>You can also leave an update on your Collideoscope report page, but note
    that updates are not forwarded to the council. They are intended as a place
    for you to update the public on anything arising from your incident.</dd>
    <dd>So, if you’ve already submitted your report, but now you would like to
    send further information to your council, you should wait until they reply
    to you, and then respond to their communication directly.</dd>

    <dt>I want to edit my report</dt>
    <dd>You can edit your report directly from the Collideoscope report page,
    but note that updates are not forwarded to the council.</dd>

    <dt>I do not wish to make a public report</dt>
    <dd>All reports made through Collideoscope are published online. Reports can
    be submitted anonymously: just check the box when you fill in the form. Note
    that the body of your report will still appear on the Collideoscope website,
    but without your name attached to it, and that your name will still be sent
    to the council.</dd>
    <dd>If your report contains potentially sensitive material, such as names or
    addresses, we suggest that you do not include these until the council has
    replied to you directly and you are in one-to-one contact.</dd>
    <dd>If your report is not suitable for publication, you should contact your
    council directly, via the contact details given on their own website.</dd>

    <dt>I’ve seen an inappropriate report/comment</dt>
    <dd>There’s a ‘report abuse’ button at the foot of every Collideoscope
    report. Please click on this and we’ll take a look as soon as we can.</dd>
    <dd>If the report or comment contravenes our rules, we’ll take it down.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="next">What now</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>The council never replied; what do I do now?</dt>
    <dd>Councils may not respond to reports, particularly where no action is
    required of them. If you’d like a reply and want to chase your council, try
    searching your email for an auto-response; you may be able to find further
    contact details there.</dd>
    <dd>If you still have no joy, you could use another handy mySociety website,
    <a href="https://www.writetothem.com">WriteToThem</a>, to contact your local
    councillors.</dd>
    <dd>You might also like to <a
    href="https://www.cyclinguk.org/groups-listing">join your local cycling
    campaigning organisation</a> and take action for better cycling provision in
    your area.</dd>

    <dt>My report is old and outdated. Can I now delete it?</dt>
    <dd>We have a policy of retaining all Collideoscope reports because they
    help create an evidence base of cycling incidents across the country. This
    data is useful for town planners and researchers who can use it as hard
    evidence to back up decisions and recommendations for safer road
    policies.</dd>
    <dd>As new reports are made, older ones drop off the first page for any
    given area, and are less likely to be discovered by those visiting the
    site.</dd>

    <dt>Can you delete my name from the site?</dt>
    <dd>Yes. Please <a href="/about/privacy">check our Privacy Policy</a> for
    full details of your rights under the GDPR and information about how to
    request this.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="accounts">Accounts</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Do I need to register with Collideoscope to use it?</dt>
    <dd>No – you can send a report without registering. When you submit your
    report, we’ll send you an email with a confirmation link.</dd>
    <dd>If you use Collideoscope regularly, you can avoid this step by creating
    an account. Once you’ve signed in, your reports will be sent as soon as you
    click ‘submit’.</dd>
    <dd>You’ll also be able to see all previous reports you’ve made on one
    page.</dd>

    <dt>I’ve forgotten my password</dt>
    <dd>Don’t worry! Visit <a
    href="https://www.collideoscope.org.uk/auth">www.collideoscope.org.uk/auth</a>
    and choose ‘No, let me sign in by email’ – then put a new password in the
    box. You’ll receive an email to confirm the change.</dd>

    <dt>I want to change my password or email address</dt>
    <dd>You can do this from your <a href="/my">account page</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="councils">Councils</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>I work for a council. How can we access data from Collideoscope?</dt>
    <dd>If your council is within Great Britain, we are already sending reports
    to you as soon as they are submitted by our users. Please <a
    href="/contact">drop us a line</a> if you’d like to check or change which
    email address we are using, or if you’d like an address added.</dd>

    <dt>Can we get more or different data in reports?</dt>
    <dd><a href="/contact">Contact us</a> to let us know what you need; it’s
    possible we’ll be able to add to or modify the report form for your
    area.</dd>

    <dt>Can we modify the text you send to people who make reports?</dt>
    <dd>Yes! If there’s something particular you’d like to include about, for
    example, your commitment to road safety, or plans for future improvements,
    just drop us a line and we can change our emails accordingly.</dd>

    <dt>How do we reply to a Collideoscope report?</dt>
    <dd>Collideoscope reports come by email. A response is not always expected,
    but if you wish to find out more from the person who made the report, or let
    them know of any action you’ll be taking as a result of their communication,
    just reply to the report email. Your response will go directly into the
    report-maker’s inbox. This and any subsequent correspondence is
    <strong>not</strong> published on the Collideoscope website.</dd>

    <dt>Can we put Collideoscope on our own council website?</dt>
    <dd>Yes. We offer branded, hosted versions of Collideoscope for local
    council websites, as we do for FixMyStreet. <a href="/contact">Get in
    touch</a> for more details.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="data">Collideoscope data</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>What kind of data can I find on this site?</dt>
    <dd>Take a look for yourself, on the <a href="/reports">Statistics page</a>.
    You can filter the charts and graphs on the page by multiple criteria,
    including location, date, and the bodies involved in the incident. You can
    also enter a council name to see a map of reports in that area. And finally,
    you can download an anonymised copy of the data as a CSV, perfect for
    analysing in Excel or Fusion Tables.</dd>

    <dt>Does all the data come from reports made on this site?</dt>
    <dd>No. By default, Collideoscope shows only reports made by Collideoscope
    users. But you can <em>also</em> choose to include all incidents involving
    bicycles from the Department for Transport’s yearly STATS19 dataset. Just
    look for the “STATS19” and “Department for Transport” options.</dd>

    <dt>What is STATS19?</dt>
    <dd>STATS19 is the name of the form on which police officers in Britain
    record incidents on the public highway involving human injury or death. This
    data is published annually by the Department for Transport. We aim to keep
    Collideoscope up to date with the latest available STATS19 data – right now
    that means cycling accidents that occured in 2012–2016. Accidents from 2017
    should become available in late 2018.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback and ideas</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>I’d like to make a Collideoscope for my own country</dt>
    <dd>Collideoscope runs on open-source code, so that’s fine. It is a
    repurposing of the FixMyStreet codebase: <a
    href="https://fixmystreet.org/">read more here</a>.</dd>

    <dt>I want to suggest an improvement </dt>
    <dd><a href="/contact">Drop us a line</a>, or <a
    href="https://github.com/mysociety/collideoscope/issues">open a ticket on
    GitHub</a> (requires registration). We value your suggestions and we do act
    on the most requested or sensible ones, when resources allow.</dd>
