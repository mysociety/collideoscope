<h1>Privacy policy</h1>

<p>
    Collideoscope is run by the charity
    <a href="https://www.mysociety.org">mySociety</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Working in the fields of transparency and accountability, mySociety thinks
    hard and cares very much about the privacy and security of our users: the
    length of this privacy policy is one demonstration of that. We’ve tried,
    though, to keep it a clear and reasonably quick read.
</p>
<p>
    We hope it covers everything you need to know, but if you still have any
    questions please feel free to contact us.
</p>

<h2>What information we collect and how we use it</h2>

<h3>When you make a report</h3>
<p>
    When you use Collideoscope to make a report, you provide personal
    information including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your name</li>
    <li>Contact details</li>
</ul>
<h4>Who gets to see the details of my incident?</h4>
<p>
    We pass the details of your incident and your name and email address to the
    council highways department or contacts responsible for the area where you
    located the problem, or other relevant highways authority. We may also share
    the details with supporting campaign groups if doing so would improve the
    understanding of cycle safety.
</p>
<p>
    At the same time, your report appears on the Collideoscope website. Your
    email address and phone number are <strong>not</strong> published; nor is
    any car number plate you have provided; and your name is only published if
    you have opted to do so.
</p>
<p>
    However, note that anything you include in the body of your report will be
    published, so please take care to keep personal information such as your
    contact details to the correct fields.
</p>
<h4>Who gets to see my personal information?</h4>
<p>
    As well as your report or update appearing on the Collideoscope website,
    your details, including name and email address, are stored in our admin
    system. If you submit a report but do not click on the link in the
    confirmation email, your report will not be published or sent to any
    authority; however, the report and your details remain in our system and
    are accessible to site administrators.
</p>
<p>
    Only staff members who we authorise to view the Collideoscope administration
    interface will be able to see your email address, and they will never use it
    for anything other than to help administer Collideoscope. We will never sell
    your email address to anyone else, or share it externally unless we are
    obliged to by law.
</p>

<h3>When you provide an update</h3>
<p>
    When you add an update to a report, we publish it on the website but do not
    routinely send it to an authority. You may opt to include your name; your
    email address is not published. As with reports, users’ details are stored
    in our admin system.
</p>

<h2>What happens when you use Collideoscope</h2>

<h3>Making a report</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We’ll email you if someone leaves an update on an incident you’ve reported.</li>
    <li>We’ll only ever send you emails in relation to your use of the site.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unsubscribing</h2>

<h3>How do I stop receiving emails from you?</h3>
<p>
    Every email we send contains an unsubscribe link.
</p>

<h2>Retention periods</h2>

<h3>Reports and updates</h3>
<p>
    Except in exceptional circumstances, we do not delete reports or updates
    made through Collideoscope. The ICO states that requests for erasure may be
    turned down when personal data is processed for archiving purposes in the
    public interest, scientific research, historical research or statistical
    purposes.
</p>
<p>
    Collideoscope reports provide an invaluable resource for researchers into
    the quantity and type of cycling incidents made across the UK during the
    years the site has been running. This research can help inform civic
    planners, developers, coders, historians and social scientists, among
    others.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, if a user asks for a report to be removed, in most cases we will
    instead offer to anonymise it, so that there is no public connection between
    the content and the user’s name. If you would like us to do this, please
    <a href="https://www.collideoscope.org.uk/contact">contact us</a>.
</p>

<h3>Support mail</h3>
<p>
    If you contact Collideoscope via our support email address we keep your
    message for two years. This is to aid continuity and so that we can view any
    historic context which may have bearing on subsequent support mail, even if
    members of the support staff change. Support staff adhere to strict internal
    privacy and security policies.
</p>

<h2>Lawful basis for processing</h2>
<p>
    In using Collideoscope for any of the functions listed above (sending a
    report, leaving an update, email alerts), we are processing your data under
    the legal basis 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation –
    legitimate interests. Our legitimate interest in processing your personal
    data is to give people an easy and public way to report cycling incidents,
    even if they don’t know who the incident reports should go to, and to send
    them updates and collect data to facilitate campaigning around related
    issues. The benefits of reporting incidents publicly are to better provide
    information for the police, highways departments, planning departments, and
    campaign groups. It also creates a snapshot for local communities, so it’s
    easy to see what the common hotspots are in a given area, and if anything
    gets done.
</p>

<h2>Your right to access</h2>
<p>
    You may contact us at any time to ask to see what personal data we hold
    about you.
</p>

<h2>Your right to erasure</h2>
<p>
    You may request that we destroy the personal data that we hold about you,
    provided that there is no legitimate reason for us continuing to hold it,
    that is to say if it is unlikely to be of any legal or practical purpose in
    the future. Please <a href="https://www.collideoscope.org.uk/contact">contact us</a>
    to request this.
</p>

<h2>Your right to object</h2>
<p>
    The General Data Protection Regulation gives you the right to object to our
    processing of your personal information and to ask us to stop processing it.
    However, it also gives us the right to continue to process it if we can
    demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override
    your interests, rights and freedoms. To exercise your right to object,
    <a href="https://www.collideoscope.org.uk/contact">contact us</a>, giving
    specific reasons why you are objecting to the processing of your personal
    data. These reasons should be based upon your particular situation.
</p>

<h2>Your right to complain</h2>
<p>
    If you believe that we have mishandled your data, you have the right to
    lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.
    <a href="https://ico.org.uk/concerns/handling/">You can report a concern here</a>
    (but do contact us first, so that we can try and help).

<h1>Cookies and third party services</h1>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">
    Our use of your data, cookies, and external services: what you should know,
    and how to opt out if you want to.
</p>

<p>
    Summary: We care a lot about our users’ privacy. We provide details below,
    and we try our hardest to look after the private data that we hold. Like
    many other websites, we sometimes use cookies and Google Analytics to help
    us make our websites better. These tools are very common and used by many
    other sites, but they do have privacy implications, and as a charity
    concerned with socially positive uses of the internet, we think it’s
    important to explain them in full. If you don’t want to share your browsing
    activities on mySociety’s sites with other companies, you can adjust your
    usage or install opt-out browser plugins.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>
    To make our service easier or more useful, we sometimes place small data
    files on your computer or mobile phone, known as cookies; many websites do
    this. We use this information to, for example, remember you have logged in
    so you don't need to do that on every page, or to measure how people use the
    website so we can improve it and make sure it works properly. Below, we list
    the cookies and services that this site can use.
</p>

<table class="nicetable">
    <tr>
        <th scope="col">Name</th>
        <th scope="col">Typical Content</th>
        <th scope="col">Expires</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>fixmystreet_app_session</td>

    </tr>

<h2>Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)</h2>

<p>
    We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use this
    site. We do this to make sure it’s meeting its users’ needs and to
    understand how we could do it better. Google Analytics stores information
    such as what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got
    here, what you click on, and information about your web browser. IP
    addresses are masked (only a portion is stored) and personal information is
    only reported in aggregate. We do not allow Google to use or share our
    analytics data for any purpose besides providing us with analytics
    information, and we recommend that any user of Google Analytics does the same.
</p>
<p>
    If you’re unhappy with data about your visit to be used in this way, you can
    install the <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">official browser
    plugin for blocking Google Analytics</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The cookies set by Google Analytics are as follows:
</p>

<table class="nicetable">
    <tr>
        <th scope="col">Name</th>
        <th scope="col">Typical Content</th>
        <th scope="col">Expires</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td>Unique anonymous visitor ID</td>
        <td>2&nbsp;years</td>

        <td>Information on how the site was reached (e.g. direct or via a link/search/advertisement)</td>
        <td>6&nbsp;months</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>__utmx</td>
        <td>Which variation of a page you are seeing if we are testing different versions to see which is best</td>
        <td>2&nbsp;years</td>
